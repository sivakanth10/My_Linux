#Automatically run commands over SSH on many servers
#to login to multiple servers those are in hosts.txt file

for host in $(cat hosts.txt); do ssh "$host" "$command" >"output.$host"; done
Authenticating with name/password is really no good idea. You should set up a private key for this:

ssh-keygen && for host in $(cat hosts.txt); do ssh-copy-id $host; done


or



Assuming that you are not able to get pssh or others installed, you could do something similar to:

tmpdir=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/pssh.$$
mkdir -p $tmpdir
count=0
while IFS= read -r userhost; do
    ssh -n -o BatchMode=yes ${userhost} 'uname -a' > ${tmpdir}/${userhost} 2>&1 &
    count=`expr $count + 1`
done < userhost.lst
while [ $count -gt 0 ]; do
    wait $pids
    count=`expr $count - 1`
done
echo "Output for hosts are in $tmpdir"
